# Thesis (LaTeX): MPDT → UD Conversion

This repository contains the LaTeX sources for Kamil Tomaszek's master’s thesis on converting the Middle Polish Dependency Treebank (MPDT) to Universal Dependencies (UD).

## Repository layout

- `main.tex` — root document that compiles the whole thesis
- `pracamgr_Kogni.cls` — custom thesis class
- `sections/` — chapter and section subfiles (compiled via the `subfiles` package)
- `figs/` — figures and plots used in the thesis
- `mybib.bib` — bibliography database (biblatex + biber)

## Notes

- The bibliography and citation styles are managed by biblatex/biber. See `mybib.bib` for entries.
- Figures are stored in `figs/`; keep vector formats (PDF/SVG) where possible for best print quality.
